# Notes by Kai

I can (on mac)
```
open RunMatsim-kai.wsx
```
and it will so far put everything together (evidently, csiro workspace needs to be installed). Haven't figured out how to use relative filenames, so will have to copy `RunMatsim-kai.wsx` to your own version and adapt accordingly.

It then, somewhat predictably, fails with `file not found` with respect to the network file.
