This is under "data/Data_from_NICTA_to_RMIT_01:05:2015".  I don't think that we ever ran this (although I am sure we could), so it is not really a "scenario".

Pieter and I also decided (in apr'18) that we want to concentrate on fem-v1.2, since those are the newer results, and they are also consistent with the *.kml files etc. (albeit not necessarily with the "nicta report" that we have).
