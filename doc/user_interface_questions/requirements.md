# User interface questions

## Population
- background traffic assumes subpopulation

## Network capacity assumptions
- add shapefile attributes as network attributes in MATSim, no hard coding of special attributes
- network base capacity: kept for background traffic? is this a switch that user will turn on or off?


## Config
- create FEM config group for specific parameters
